Hi, I'm Henil 👋

🎓 Computer Science student (Class of 2028–2029)
🎮 Aspiring Software Engineer — aiming to work in the game industry (Riot Games is the dream)
💻 Currently learning programming from the ground up and building real systems projects.

🚀 What I'm Doing Right Now

Learning Python fundamentals → transitioning into C++ for systems & game engineering

Building small projects inspired by real gameplay mechanics (damage systems, stats tracking, simulations)

Developing strong problem-solving skills and understanding how software works under the hood

🎯 Long-Term Goal

Become a skilled systems/software engineer capable of working on large-scale multiplayer games — networking, performance, and gameplay logic.

🛠️ Tech I'm Learning

Python (foundations)

Git & GitHub (version control)

VS Code (development environment)

(C++ and Data Structures coming next as I progress.)

📚 Current Focus

I’m focused on mastering the fundamentals first — writing clean code, understanding algorithms, and building projects that simulate real-world systems instead of just following tutorials.

🎮 Fun Fact

A lot of my practice projects are inspired by Valorant mechanics, because the best way to learn is to build things you actually care about.

📈 This GitHub Tracks My Growth

This isn’t a showcase of finished expertise — it’s a record of consistent improvement as I grow into a professional developer.
